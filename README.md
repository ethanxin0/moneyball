### Analysis Descriptions
**Analysis 1:** The focus of this analysis was to create a predictive machine learning model that predicts key offensive performance indicators: batting average (BA), on-base percentage (OBP), and slugging percentage (SLG). We used a dataset of detailed offensive statistics for qualified batters (those with over 500 plate appearances) from the 2015 to 2023 seasons, excluding the 2020 season due to its incomplete nature, which could introduce anomalies that affect the accuracy of the model

**Analysis 2:** Focused on the impact of various weather conditions on offensive baseball metrics during the Boston Red Sox's home games from 2013 to 2023, excluding the 2020 season. We concentrated on a single team’s home games, with the purpose of eliminating the variability associated with different ballparks and away games.

**Analysis 3:** For this analysis, we examined a couple offensive metrics for the  Colorado Rockies from 2011-2023, who play at 5183 feet, comparing their offensive metrics at home vs away

**Analysis 4:** The implementations of the pitch clock changed the game in many ways. Aimed to increase an attempt in stolen bases and make games more offensvie to draw back the crowd since COVID, we examine how the pitch clock affected the game

**Analysis 5:** The central question of this analysis is which position has historically produced the most offensively. This question is crucial not only for baseball analysts and coaches, who aim to optimize team performance, but also for fans interested in the intricacies of the game. 

**Analysis 6:** This analysis sought to explore the relationship between a team's individual performance and their financial success. Key indicators like home runs, hits, and win-loss ratio were measured against their corresponding impact on a team’s financial success.
