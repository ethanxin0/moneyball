### Preface
- On the surface, the sport of baseball may seem simple, throw the ball, swing the bat, and hit it as far as possible. However, the game is full of a wealth of statistics that allow for a considerable amount of in-depth statistical analysis. With detailed records of every pitch and swing spanning over 70 years, baseball offers a unique opportunity for teams, players, analysts, and students.
- 
- This project tackles six key research questions, exploring everything from predictive models of player performance and positional advantages to the impact of weather, elevation, rule changes, and financial success on team outcomes. Since the mid-20th century, the science of baseball, known as sabermetrics, has revolutionized how teams utilize statistics to approach the game. With the introduction of Statcast in 2015, nearly every aspect of a player’s game can now be measured, allowing for more informed decision-making. Our project intends to contribute to this ongoing evolution by providing insights that can enhance player development, improve valuations, and sustain a competitive advantage in an increasingly data-driven sport. Understanding these different factors is crucial not just for teams and analysts but for anyone invested in the future of baseball and specifically optimal offensive production.

### Analysis Descriptions
**Analysis 1:** The focus of this analysis was to create a predictive machine learning model that predicts key offensive performance indicators: batting average (BA), on-base percentage (OBP), and slugging percentage (SLG). We used a dataset of detailed offensive statistics for qualified batters (those with over 500 plate appearances) from the 2015 to 2023 seasons, excluding the 2020 season due to its incomplete nature, which could introduce anomalies that affect the accuracy of the model

**Analysis 2:** Focused on the impact of various weather conditions on offensive baseball metrics during the Boston Red Sox's home games from 2013 to 2023, excluding the 2020 season. We concentrated on a single team’s home games, with the purpose of eliminating the variability associated with different ballparks and away games.

**Analysis 3:** For this analysis, we examined a couple offensive metrics for the  Colorado Rockies from 2011-2023, who play at 5183 feet, comparing their offensive metrics at home vs away

**Analysis 4:** The implementations of the pitch clock changed the game in many ways. Aimed to increase an attempt in stolen bases and make games more offensvie to draw back the crowd since COVID, we examine how the pitch clock affected the game

**Analysis 5:** The central question of this analysis is which position has historically produced the most offensively. This question is crucial not only for baseball analysts and coaches, who aim to optimize team performance, but also for fans interested in the intricacies of the game. 

**Analysis 6:** This analysis sought to explore the relationship between a team's individual performance and their financial success. Key indicators like home runs, hits, and win-loss ratio were measured against their corresponding impact on a team’s financial success.
