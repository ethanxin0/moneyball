### Analysis Descriptions
**- Analysis 1:** The focus of this analysis was to create a predictive machine learning model that predicts key offensive performance indicators: batting average (BA), on-base percentage (OBP), and slugging percentage (SLG). We used a dataset of detailed offensive statistics for qualified batters (those with over 500 plate appearances) from the 2015 to 2023 seasons, excluding the 2020 season due to its incomplete nature, which could introduce anomalies that affect the accuracy of the model

**- Analysis 2:** Focused on the impact of various weather conditions on offensive baseball metrics during the Boston Red Sox's home games from 2013 to 2023, excluding the 2020 season. We concentrated on a single teamâ€™s home games, with the purpose of eliminating the variability associated with different ballparks and away games.

**- Analysis 3:** For this analysis, we examined a couple offensive metrics for the  Colorado Rockies from 2011-2023, who play at 5183 feet, comparing their offensive metrics at home vs away
